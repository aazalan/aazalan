## Projects on CodePen
My small projects I posted on the CodePen where you can consider their functionality and discover my code. Cause the React provides two ways of building architecture of Frontend, some of projects is designed on functions using hooks and other are written using older React way of developing using classes: [CodePen collection with React projects](https://codepen.io/collection/NqyjZj?cursor=eyJjb2xsZWN0aW9uX2lkIjoiTnF5alpqIiwiY29sbGVjdGlvbl90b2tlbiI6bnVsbCwibGltaXQiOjQsIm1heF9pdGVtcyI6MTEsIm9mZnNldCI6MCwicGFnZSI6MSwic29ydF9ieSI6InBvc2l0aW9uIiwic29ydF9vcmRlciI6IkFzYyJ9).
